🌻 **Flowers Classification Competition**

**Goal:** Build a robust deep learning model to classify 5 flower species — Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.
**Primary Metric:** `F1-Macro Score` — ensures balanced accuracy across all classes, penalizing bias toward dominant species.

🧠 **Model Architecture**

A custom **3-layer CNN** built from scratch in PyTorch — no pre-trained weights or transfer learning.

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Feature Extraction | 3× `Conv2d` + `ReLU` + `MaxPool2d` |
| Classifier | Flattened → 2 fully connected layers |
| Loss Function | `CrossEntropyLoss` |
| Optimizer | `Adam` — 10 epochs |



🚀 **Performance**

Achieved an **F1-Macro of 0.5884** on the test set.

- ✅ **Best class:** Sunflower — high color distinctiveness made it the easiest to isolate
- ⚠️ **Hardest pair:** Rose vs. Tulip — similar shape and color profiles caused the most confusion



🛠️ **Reproducing the Results**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Train the model (auto-detects GPU if available)
python train.py

# 3. Evaluate — generates F1 score + full classification report
python evaluation/metrics.py
```



⚙️ **Automated Leaderboard System**

Powered by a custom **GitHub Actions bot**. Every time `scores.json` is updated, it automatically:
1. Sorts participants by accuracy
2. Formats a new Markdown leaderboard table
3. Pushes the update to `leaderboard/README.md`

No manual updates needed — the rankings stay live and current.



> 📌 **Note on Model Weights:** `checkpoint.pth` was trained on Kaggle (GPU T4 ×2). Due to GitHub's 25MB file limit, weights are hosted in the [Kaggle output folder](#) linked to this project.
